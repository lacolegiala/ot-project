# Architecture

## User interface

The user interface contains two views: one for selecting the difficulty level, and one for playing the game. There is only one scene, though: the GridPane containing the cards will appear when the level is chosen. The UI is programmed in the class com.mycompany.findthepair.ui.UI.java.
